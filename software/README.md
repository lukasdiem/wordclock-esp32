# Software

This section of the [Wordclock project](../README.md) covers the software running on the clock's ESP32.


## Features

[TODO: add detailed description]

## Demo video

[Here's a video](https://youtu.be/WF_X5soabm0) showing the Wordclock and its web interface in action.

## Arduino IDE setup

### Add ESP32 boards

As this project is using Arduino IDE, you need to install the [Arduino core for the ESP32](https://github.com/espressif/arduino-esp32). To do so, the preferred method is to use the Boards Manager and is detailed [here](https://github.com/espressif/arduino-esp32/blob/master/docs/arduino-ide/boards_manager.md).

Once installed, select the ESP32 board from `Tools > Board > ESP32 Arduino > ESP32 Dev Module` (or whatever is most appropriate for your specific board).

_Note: you might also need to install the appropriate USB driver for your ESP32 board (for example if it has a CP210x USB to UART bridge, it's [this one](https://www.silabs.com/developers/usb-to-uart-bridge-vcp-drivers))._

### Add required dependencies

This project relies on several additional libraries that need to be installed in the Arduino IDE. Open the Library Manager (`Tools > Manage Libraries...`), then search an add the following:

- [RTClib](https://github.com/adafruit/RTClib) by Adafruit
- [IotWebConf](https://github.com/prampec/IotWebConf) by Balazs Kelemen **version 2.3.x** (not compatible with version 3 yet)
- [NeoPixelBus](https://github.com/Makuna/NeoPixelBus) by Michael C. Mille
- [Adafruit BusIO](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_BusIO) by Adafruit

You are now ready to compile and flash the [`wordclock.ino` sketch](wordclock/wordclock.ino).

## OTA update

After the firmware has been flashed over USB once, you can use the OTA feature to flash further updates: build the new binary file from the Arduino IDE (`Sketch > Export compiled Binary`), then open the web portal of your clock, click the `Firmware update` link at the bottom and upload the new `.bin` file.

## Credits

A large part of this source was based on the code from these two projects (both of which were written for the same hardware):
- https://github.com/e-noyau/wordclock (for the clockface and overall architecture)
- https://bitbucket.org/gliktaras/word-clock (for the configuration portal)
